Alternate test fixtures for [Privacy Badger](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger).

These are used for testing third-party interactions, when we need the fixture to be served by a domain different from the primary test domain.

Primary fixtures live in https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger-test-fixtures.

Privacy Badger is a project of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org).
